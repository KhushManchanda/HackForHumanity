Sometimes he would miss school because the snow was too deep. One time, he walked to school in a blizzard and the snow was so deep that he couldn't see where he was going. He walked for hours until he finally found his way home.</p>

      <p class="card__title">My grandfather always told me that when he was a young man, he had to go to war. He saw many of his friends die in battle, and he was never the same after he came home. He would often sit in silence for hours, just staring off into space. One day, he just stopped talking altogether. He died a few years later, never having spoken again.</p>

      <p class="card__title">I was out walking my dog the other day when I ran into my old friend from high school. We chatted for a bit, catching up on each other's lives, and then she invited me to her daughter's birthday party next weekend. I was so happy to have reconnected with her and to have been invited to the party.</p>

      <p class="card__title">My day starts off like any other. I wake up, make myself breakfast, and then settle in front of the TV to watch the news. After a while, I start to feel restless and decide to go for a walk around the block. As I walk, I wave to my neighbors, but they all seem to be too busy to wave back. I begin to feel lonely and wonder if anyone even notices me.

        When I get back to my house, I sit down at my desk and try to work on my stamp collection, but I can't seem to focus. I finally give up and decide to take a nap. When I wake up, it's already evening. I make myself some dinner, but I can't help but feel a little sad and lonely. I go to bed early, hoping that tomorrow will be a better day.</p>

      <p class="card__title">My day usually starts with a cup of coffee and the newspaper. I read the paper, do the crossword, and then watch some TV. I might take a walk later on, if the weather is nice. I generally make myself a light lunch and then spend the rest of the afternoon reading or working on my stamp collection. I might watch some more TV later on, or perhaps listen to the radio. I generally make myself a simple dinner and then spend the evening reading or watching TV. I go to bed around 10 or 11 pm.</p>
